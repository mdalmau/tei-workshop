                            <p> The MLA Bibliography staff has created a thesaurus of over 50,000
                                terms and 200,000 names to ensure consistency in the terms and names
                                assigned during indexing. The VWWP project will utilize a subset of
                                the MLA Thesaurus to assign genre headings to the VWWP texts. The
                                genre terms are further enhanced by definitions compiled from
                                various sources such as <title level="m">The Oxford Dictionary of
                                    Literary Terms</title>. </p>

                <p><hi rendition="#small-caps"><persName ref="alfredgatty">ALFRED GATTY</persName></hi> was an
                    English clergyman, vicar of Ecclesfield in Yorkshire, where in 1841 his daughter
                        <persName ref="julianaewing">Juliana Horatia</persName>, afterward <persName
                        ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName>, was born. The
                        <persName>Gattys</persName> seem to have been an exceptionally clever
                    family. While the children were still very young they learned to amuse each
                    other by story-telling, and a little later they edited and wrote a
                    story-magazine, which was not printed, but circulated in manuscript among their
                    friends. <persName ref="julianaewing">Juliana</persName> was particularly good
                    as an oral story-teller and mimic, and even as a child evidently had something
                    of the magnetism which is so important an element in her nature work. Indeed,
                    one can hardly think of her written stories as mere compositions; the author
                    seems to be talking to us frankly and unaffectedly, and paper and ink serve only
                    as conductors for that sweet and friendly voice. Her first book of stories was
                    published when she was twenty-one years old, and from that time to the end of
                    her not very long life she was producing tales in prose and verse, most of them
                    about children.</p>
                <p>In 1866 began the publication of " Aunt Judy's Magazine," edited by the
                        <persName>Gattys</persName>, and really the public continuation of the
                    nursery magazine with which they had grown up. At twenty-five <persName
                        ref="julianaewing">Miss Juliana Gatty</persName> was married to <persName
                        ref="majorewing">Major Ewing</persName> of the British Army. Soon afterward
                    hewas stationed in <placeName>New Brunswick</placeName>, where <persName
                        ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName> and he lived for several <pb n="iv"
                        xml:id="VAB6984-007"
                        facs="http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/vwwp/large/VAB6984-007"/> years.
                    Here she naturally learned a good deal about army life. It is odd that although
                    she was continually writing stories, many of which were published in "Aunt
                    Judy's Magazine," it did not occur to her for some time to make literary use of
                    her army experience. At last in 1872, she wrote her first soldier story, "The
                    Peace Egg." This tale is not very well known now, but the two which followed,
                    "Jackanapes," and "The Story of a Short Life," not only became quickly popular,
                    but are as widely read and as generously cried over to-day as they ever
                    were.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the <persName>Ewings</persName> had returned to
                        <placeName>England</placeName>, where <persName ref="julianaewing">Mrs.
                        Ewing</persName> lived for the rest of her life. In 1873 a part-editorship
                    of "Aunt Judy's Magazine" fell into her hands, and was retained for about two
                    years. But she had always been delicate. The routine of regular work was very
                    difficult for her; and when, a few years after the return from <placeName>New
                        Brunswick</placeName>, <persName ref="majorewing">Major Ewing</persName> was
                    transferred to <placeName>Malta</placeName>, she was not strong enough to go
                    with him. Consequently they were separated for several years, and when he was
                    finally ordered back to <placeName>England</placeName> she had not long to live;
                    she died at <placeName>Bath</placeName> in 1885.</p>
                <p>The secret of <persName ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName>'s charm is
                    hardly a secret at all. As a woman she was simple, sympathetic, and universally
                    beloved; and she was the rare sort of person who is just as lovable in print as
                    in real life. She is a writer of sentiment, but of sentiment wholly free from
                    mawkishness or strained pathos. Her work is marked by a tender humor which
                    reminds one of <persName>Dr. John Brown</persName> more than of anybody else. We
                    are not so tolerant of the pathetic as our fathers were in the days of
                        <persName>Colonel Newcome</persName> and <persName>Little Nell</persName>. A
                    good many people find fault nowadays with <persName ref="julianaewing">Mrs.

                    stories because they are so sad. But if the reader is not too ready to be cast
                    down, he will notice that <persName ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName>
                    herself is never so sad that she is not a little merry too. She does not admit
                    that the sacrifice of <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName>'s life
                    was a waste, or a slip on the part of Providence; and the lifelong grief of the
                    poor <persName>Doctor</persName> in "The Brownies," instead of embittering him,
                    makes him more tender and considerate of the happiness of those who have not yet
                    known the hard discipline of bereavement. <persName ref="julianaewing">Mrs.
                        Ewing</persName> might not have been willing, considering them from a larger
                    point of view than what is comfortable to one's feelings, to admit that her
                    stories do not "turn out right." She evidently perceived that pain and death are
                    as valuable incidents in human experience as life and happiness; or, rather -
                    for she was a great lover of life and happiness - she seems to have felt that
                    pain and death are preferable to selfishness and dishonor.</p>
                <p><persName ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName>'s style was the direct
                    expression of her nature, simple and spontaneous, yet with the unmistakable
                    hall-mark of social and literary good-breeding. It would not be an exaggeration
                    to say, adapt- ing the phrase so often used of <persName>Thackeray</persName>,
                    that one of her chief distinctions is to have written like a gentlewoman. But
                    this quality alone would not account for her continued popularity, any more than
                    to have written like a gentleman accounts for <persName>Thackeray</persName>'s.
                    We must refer it rather to the sweet and sound philosophy, the gracious
                    womanhood, which are at the basis of all her work.</p>

                        that it was bad manners to do so "in a mixed assembly."</p>

                        "the Michaelmas before that," and "the Michaelmas before the Michaelmas
                        before that." After this her head, which was small, became confused, and she

                        was used for strange purposes. A political meeting was held on it with the

                        speaker who came by stage-coach from the town, where they had wrecked the

                        keep him on the <placeName>Green</placeName>. They took him to the pond and
                        tried to make him swim, which he could not do, and the whole affair was very
                        disturbing to all quiet and peaceable fowls. After which another man came,

                        It was all part and parcel of the war and bad times. He was called the

                        less than a century ago news had to travel at the same slow rate, so that
                        the mail coach played a very important part at such moments as the Waterloo
                        victory.</note>

                        <persName ref="goose">Gray Goose</persName> remembered quite well the year
                        that <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName> began to walk, for it
                        was the year that the speckled hen for the first time in all her motherly
                        life got out of patience when she was sitting. She had been rather proud of
                        the eggs, - they were unusually large, - but she never felt quite
                        comfortable on them; and whether it was because she used to get cramp and go
                        off the nest, or because the season was bad, or what, she never could tell;
                        but every egg was addled but one, and the one that did batch gave her more
                        trouble than any chick she had ever reared.</p>
                    <p>It was a fine, downy, bright yellow little thing, but it had a monstrous big
                        nose and feet, and such an ungainly walk as she knew no other instance of in
                        her well-bred and high-stepping family. And as to behavior, it was not that
                        it was either quarrelsome or moping, but simply unlike the rest. When the
                        other chicks hopped and cheeped on the <placeName>Green</placeName> about
                        their mother's feet, this solitary yellow brat went waddling off on its own
                        responsibility, and do or cluck <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB6984-021" facs="http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/vwwp/large/VAB6984-021"/> what the
                        speckled hen would, it went to play in the Pond.</p>
                    <p>It was off one day as usual, and the hen was fussing and fuming after it,
                        when the <persName ref="postman">Postman</persName>, going to deliver a
                        letter at <persName ref="bigmiss">Miss Jessamine</persName>'s door, was
                        nearly knocked over by the good lady herself, who, bursting out of the house
                        with her cap just off and her bonnet just not on, fell into his arms,
                        crying, - </p>
                    <p><said who="bigmiss">"Baby! Baby! <persName ref="jackanapes"

                    <p>If the <persName ref="postman">Postman</persName> loved anything on earth, he
                        loved the <persName ref="captain">Captain</persName>'s yellow-haired child;
                        so, propping <persName ref="bigmiss">Miss Jessamine</persName> against her
                        own door-post, he followed the direction of her trembling fingers and made
                        for the <placeName>Green</placeName>.</p>
                    <p><persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName> had had the start of the
                            <persName ref="postman">Postman</persName> by nearly ten minutes. The
                        world - the round, green world with an oak-tree on it - was just becoming
                        very interesting to him. He had tried, vigorously but ineffectually, to
                        mount a passing pig the last time he was taken out walking; but then he was
                        encumbered with a nurse. Now he was his own master, and might, by courage
                        and energy, become the master of that delightful downy, dumpy, yellow thing
                        that was bobbing along over the green grass in front of him. Forward!
                        Charge! He aimed well, and grabbed it, but only to feel the delicious
                        downiness and dumpiness slipping through his fingers as he fell upon his
                        face. <said>"Quack!"</said> said the yellow thing, and wabbled off sideways.
                        It was this oblique movement that enabled <persName ref="jackanapes"
                            >Jackanapes</persName> to come up with it, for it was bound for the
                        Pond, and therefore obliged to come back into line. He failed again from
                        top-heaviness, and his prey escaped sideways as before, and, as before, lost
                        ground in getting back to the direct road to the Pond.</p>

                    <p>And at the Pond the <persName ref="postman">Postman</persName> found them
                        both, - one yellow thing rocking safely on the ripples that lie beyond
                        duck-weed, and the other washing his draggled frock with tears because he
                        too had tried to sit upon the Pond and it would n't hold him.</p>

                        a ghastly face all besmirched with tears. He was unusually subdued.</p>

                        and <persName ref="mrsj">Mrs. Johnson</persName>, and if the still more
                        incredible paradox can be that ladies may differ over a point on which they
                        are agreed, that point was the admitted fact that <persName ref="tony">Tony
                            Johnson</persName> was "delicate"; and the difference lay chiefly in
                        this: <persName ref="mrsj">Mrs. Johnson</persName> said that <persName
                            ref="tony">Tony</persName> was delicate, - meaning that he was more
                        finely strung, more sensitive, a properer subject for pampering and petting,
                        than <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName>, and that,
                        consequently, <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName> was to blame
                        for leading <persName ref="tony">Tony</persName> into scrapes which resulted
                        in his being chilled, frightened, or (most frequently) sick. But when
                            <persName ref="bigmiss">Miss Jessamine</persName> said that <persName
                            ref="tony">Tony Johnson</persName> was delicate, she meant that he was
                        more puling, less manly, and less healthily brought up than <persName

                        had been so very sick with riding Bucephalus<ref rendition="#super"
                            target="#note_025">1</ref> in the giddy-go-round. <persName ref="mrsj"
                            >Mrs. Johnson</persName> had explained to <persName ref="bigmiss">Miss

                            >Tony</persName> was so easily upset was the unusual sensitiveness (as a
                        doctor had explained it to her) of the nervous centres in her family -
                        "Fiddlestick!" So <persName ref="mrsj">Mrs. Johnson</persName> understood
                            <persName ref="bigmiss">Miss Jessamine</persName> to say; but it
                        appeared that she only said "Treaclestick!" <ref rendition="#super"
                            target="#note_026">2</ref> - which is quite another thing, and of which
                            <persName ref="tony">Tony</persName> was undoubtedly fond.</p>
                    <p>It was at the Fair that <persName ref="tony">Tony</persName> was made ill by
                        riding on Bucephalus. Once a year the <placeName>Goose Green</placeName>
                        became the scene of a carnival. First of all, carts and caravans were
                        rumbling up all along, day and night. <persName ref="jackanapes"
                            >Jackanapes</persName> could hear them as he lay in bed, and could
                        hardly sleep for speculating what booths and whirligigs he should find
                        fairly established when he and his dog Spitfire went out after breakfast. As
                        a matter of fact, he seldom had to wait so long for news of the Fair. The
                            <persName ref="postman">Postman</persName> knew the window out of which

                    <p>No doubt it was partly because he had already suffered severely in the Flying
                        Boats that <persName ref="tony">Tony</persName> collapsed so quickly in the
                        giddy-go-round. He only mounted Bucephalus (who was spotted, and had no
                        tail) because <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName> urged him,
                        and held out the ingenious hope that the round-and-round feeling would very
                        likely cure the up-and-down sensation. It did not, however, and <persName
                            ref="tony">Tony</persName> tumbled off during the first revolution.</p>
                    <p><persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName> was not absolutely free from
                        qualms; but having once mounted the Black Prince, he stuck to him as a
                        horseman should. During his first round he waved his hat, and observed with
                        some concern that the Black Prince had lost an ear since last Fair; at the
                        second, he looked a little pale, but sat upright, though somewhat
                        unnecessarily rigid; at the third round he shut his eyes. During the fourth
                        his hat fell off, and he clasped his horse's neck. By the fifth he had laid
                        his yellow head against the Black Prince's mane, and so clung anyhow till
                        the hobby-horses stopped, when the proprietor assisted him to alight, and he
                        sat down rather suddenly and said he had enjoyed it very much.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="goose">Gray Goose</persName> always ran away at the first
                        approach of the caravans, and never came back to the
                            <placeName>Green</placeName> till there was nothing left of the Fair but
                        footmarks and oyster-shells. Running away was her pet principle; the only
                        system, she maintained, by which you can live long and easily and lose
                        nothing. If you run away when you see danger, you can come back when all is
                        safe. Run quickly, return slowly, hold your head high, and gabble as loud as
                        you can, and you'll preserve the respect of the <placeName>Goose
                            Green</placeName> to a peaceful old age. Why should you struggle and get

                    <p>Grass soon grows over footprints, and the village children took the

                        of Fair-time in which <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName> was
                        deeply interested. "The <placeName>Green</placeName>" proper was originally
                        only part of a straggling common, which in its turn merged into some wilder
                        waste land where Gypsies sometimes squatted if the authorities would allow
                        them, especially after the annual Fair. And it was after the Fair that
                            <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName>, out rambling by
                        himself, was knocked over by the <persName ref="gypsy">Gypsy</persName>'s

                        none the worse except for being heels over head in love with the red-haired

                    <p>The Gypsy <persName ref="gboy">boy</persName> had had a fright, and he was

                    <p>A few days later, <persName ref="bigmiss">Miss Jessamine</persName> spoke
                        very seriously to <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName>. She was
                        a good deal agitated as she told him that his grandfather the <persName

                        behavior during the visit. If it had been feasible to leave off calling him
                            <persName ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName> and to get used to his
                        baptismal name of <persName ref="jackanapes">Theodore</persName> before the

                        had scruples about it on principle. It would not seem quite truthful,
                        although she had always most fully intended that he should be called
                            <persName ref="jackanapes">Theodore</persName> when he had outgrown the
                        ridiculous appropriateness of his nickname. The fact was that he had not
                        outgrown it, but he must take care to remember who was meant when his
                        grandfather said <persName ref="jackanapes">Theodore</persName>. Indeed, for
                        that matter, he must take care all along.</p>

                    <p>One effect of the conquest which the <persName ref="general"

                        Indeed, the village was now somewhat importantly represented in the army.
                        There was the <persName ref="general">General</persName> himself, and the

                        managed to keep hold of it. It was in trying to remount that he discovered,

                        and that no feat of which he was master would get him into the saddle. Not

                        but of loneliness; and then, dragging himself up by the side of his horse,
                        he turned the other way and drew out his pistol, and waited for the end.
                        Whether he waited seconds or minutes he never knew, before some one gripped

                    <p>It was when they were fairly off that a sudden upspringing of the enemy in

                    <p>When <persName ref="tony">Tony</persName> became aware of it, several things

                        not; 4, that this, if he could seize it, was the supremest of all the
                        moments in which he had tried to assume the virtues which <persName
                            ref="jackanapes">Jackanapes</persName> had by nature; and that if he
                        could be courageous and unselfish now -</p>
                    <p>He caught at his own reins and spoke very loud, -</p>

                        and face. He turned with an odd look in his eyes that a vainer man than

                        had fair, floating hair, which the breeze blew into her eyes; and between
                        the cloud of hair, and the mist of tears, she could not see her work very
                        clearly. She neither tied up her locks, nor dried her eyes, however; for
                        when one is miserable, one may as well be completely so.</p>
                    <p><said who="doc">" What is the matter ? "</said> said the <persName ref="doc"
                            >Doctor</persName>, who was a friend of the <persName ref="rector"
                            >Rector</persName>'s, and came into the garden whenever he pleased.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="doc">Doctor</persName> was a tall stout man, with hair as
                        black as crows' feathers on the top, and gray underneath, and a bushy beard.
                        When young, he had been slim and handsome, with wonderful eyes, which were
                        wonderful still; but that was many years past. He had a great love for
                        children, and this one was a particular friend of his.</p>
                    <p><said who="doc">" What is the matter ? "</said> said he.</p>
                    <p><said who="tiny">"I 'm in a row,"</said> murmured the young lady through her
                        veil; and the needle went in damp, and came out with a jerk, which is apt to
                        result in what ladies called "puckering."</p>
                    <p><said who="doc">"You are like <placeName>London</placeName> in a yellow
                            fog,"</said> said the <persName ref="doc">Doctor</persName>, throwing
                        himself on to the grass, <said who="doc">" and it is very depressing to my
                            feelings. What is the row about, and how came you to get into it
                            ?"</said></p>
                    <p><said who="tiny">"We 're all in it,"</said> was the reply; and apparently <pb
                            n="42" xml:id="VAB6984-051"/> the fog was thickening, for the voice grew
                        less and less distinct - <said who="tiny">"the boys and everybody. It's all
                            about forgetting, and not putting away, and leaving about, and
                            borrowing, and breaking, and that sort of thing. I've had father's new
                            pocket handkerchiefs to hem, and I've been out climbing with the boys,
                            and kept forgetting and forgetting, and mother says I always forget; and
                            I can't help it. I forget to tidy his newspapers for him, and I forget
                            to feed Puss, and I forgot these; besides, they're a great bore, and
                            mother gave them to Nurse to do, and this one was lost, and we found it
                            this morning tossing about in the toy-cupboard."</said></p>
                    <p><said who="doc">" It looks as if it had been taking violent exercise,"</said>
                        said the <persName ref="doc">Doctor</persName>. <said who="doc">" But what
                            have the boys to do with it ? "</said></p>
                    <p><said who="tiny">" Why, then there was a regular turn out of the
                            toys,"</said> she explained, <said who="tiny">"and they're all in a
                            regular mess. You know we always go on till the last minute, and then
                            things get crammed in anyhow. <persName ref="mary">Mary</persName> and I
                            did tidy them once or twice; but the boys never put anything away, you
                            know, so what 's the good ? "</said></p>
                    <p><said who="doc">"What, indeed ! "</said> said the <persName ref="doc"
                            >Doctor</persName>. <said who="doc">"And so you have complained of them
                            ? "</said></p>
                    <p><said who="tiny">"Oh, no !"</said> answered she. <said who="tiny">"We don't
                            get them into rows, unless they are very provoking; but some of the
                            things were theirs, so everybody was sent for, and I was sent out to
                            finish this, and they are all tidying. I don't know when it will be
                            done, for I have all this side to hem; and the soldier's box is broken,
                            and Noah is lost out of the <persName>Noah</persName>'s Ark, and so is
                            one of the elephants and a guinea-pig, and so is the rocking-horse's
                            nose; and nobody knows what has become of
                                <placeName>Rutlandshire</placeName> and the
                                <placeName>Wash</placeName>, but they're so <pb n="43"

                    <p>The <persName ref="doc">Doctor</persName> started up in affected horror.
                            <said who="doc">" <placeName>Europe</placeName> gone, did you say? Bless

                        with her dangling feet, and trying not to laugh. <said who="tiny">"You know

                    <p>One early spring morning about twenty years before, a man going to his work
                        at sunrise through the churchyard stopped by a flat stone which he had
                        lately helped to lay down. The day before, a name had been cut on it, which
                        he stayed to read; and below the name some one had scrawled a few words in
                        pencil, which he read also - <hi rendition="#i">Pitifully behold the sorrows of
                            our hearts.</hi> On the stone lay a pencil, and a few feet from it lay
                        the <persName ref="doc">Doctor</persName>, face downwards, as he had lain
                        all night, with the hoar frost on his black hair.</p>
                    <p>Ah ! these gravestones (they were ugly things in those days; not the light,
                        hopeful, pretty crosses we set up now), how they seem remorselessly to
                        imprison and keep our dear dead friends away from us ! And yet they do not
                        lie with a feather's weight upon the souls that are gone, while
                            <persName>God</persName> only knows how heavily they press upon the
                        souls that are left behind. Did the spirit whose body was with the dead
                        stand that morning by the body whose spirit was with the dead, <pb n="48"
                            xml:id="VAB6984-057"/> and pity him? Let us only talk about what we
                        know.</p>
                    <p>After this it was said that the <persName ref="doc">Doctor</persName> had got
                        a fever, and was dying, but he got better of it; and then that he was out of
                        his mind, but he got better of that, and came out looking much as usual,
                        except that his hair never seemed quite so black again, as if a little of
                        that night's hoar frost still remained. And no further misfortune happened
                        to him that I ever heard of ; and as time went on he grew a beard, and got
                        stout, and kept a German poodle, and gave tea-parties to other people's
                        children. As to the gravestone story, whatever it was to him at the end of
                        twenty years, it was a great convenience to his friends; for when he said
                        anything they did n't agree with, or did anything they could n't understand,
                        or did n't say or do what was expected of him, what could be easier or more
                        conclusive than to shake one's head and say,-</p>

                        TEA-PARTY.</head>
                    <p>There is one great advantage attendant upon invitations to tea with a doctor.
                        No objections can be raised on the score of health. It is obvious that it
                        must be fine enough to go out when the <persName ref="doc">Doctor</persName>
                        asks you, and that his tea-cakes may be eaten with perfect impunity.</p>
                    <p>Those tea-cakes were always good; to-night they were utterly delicious; there
                        was a perfect abandon of currants, and the amount of citron peel was
                        enervating to behold. Then the housekeeper waited in awful splendor, and yet
                        the <persName ref="doc">Doctor</persName>'s authority over her seemed as
                        absolute as if he were an Eastern despot. <persName ref="deordie"
                            >Deordie</persName> must be excused for believing in the <pb n="48"
                            xml:id="VAB6984-058"/> charms of living alone. It certainly has its
                        advantages. The limited sphere of duty conduces to discipline in the
                        household, demand does not exceed supply in the article of waiting, and
                        there is not that general scrimmage of conflicting interests which besets a
                        large family in the most favored circumstances. The housekeeper waits in
                        black silk, and looks as if she had no meaner occupation than to sit in a
                        rocking- chair, and dream of damson cheese.</p>

                        who seemed quite used to the proceedings ; and there under the veranda,
                        framed with passion flowers and geraniums, the <persName ref="doc"
                            >Doctor</persName> had gathered mats, rugs, cushions, and armchairs, for
                        the party; while far up in the sky a yellow-faced harvest moon looked down
                        in awful benignity.</p>

                        pertinacious in her opinions. She knew the private history of almost every

                                        who domesticate themselves in a house of which some grown-up
                                        human being pays the rent and taxes. They are like small
                                        editions of men and women, they are too small and fragile
                                        for heavy work; they have not the strength of a man, but are
                                        a thousand times more fresh and nimble. They can run and
                                        jump, and roll and tumble, with marvellous agility and
                                        endurance, and of many of the aches and pains which men and
                                        women groan under, they do not even know the names. They
                                        have no trade or profession, and as they live entirely upon
                                        other people, they know nothing of domestic cares; in fact,
                                        they know very little upon any subject, though they are
                                        often intelligent and highly inquisitive. They love
                                        dainties, play, and mischief. They are apt to be greatly
                                        beloved, and are themselves capriciously affectionate. They
                                        are little people, and can only do little things. When they
                                        are idle and mischievous, they are called Boggarts, and are
                                        a curse to the house they live in. When they are useful and
                                        considerate, they are Brownies, and are a much coveted
                                        blessing. Sometimes the Blessed Brownies will take up their
                                        abode with some worthy couple, cheer them with their romps
                                        and merry laughter, tidy the house, find things that have
                                        been lost, and take little troubles out of hands full of
                                        great anxieties. Then in time these Little People are
                                        Brownies no longer. They grow up into men and women. They do
                                        not care so much for dainties, play, or mischief. They cease
                                        to jump and tumble, and roll about the house. They know
                                        more, and laugh less. Then, when their heads begin to ache
                                        with anxiety, and they have to labor for their own living,
                                        and the great cares of life come on, other Brownies come and

                    <p>The fire was very successful. <persName ref="johnnie">Johnnie</persName> went

                            should be sure to find some, and they would do for

                        upon the grass by the roadside, and over the miles of network that the
                        spiders had woven from blossom to blossom of the <pb n="72"
                            xml:id="VAB6984-081"/> heather. The dew is the sun's breakfast; but he
                        was barely up yet, and had not eaten it, and the world felt anything but
                        warm. Nevertheless, it was so sweet and fresh as it is at no later hour of
                        the day, and every sound was like the returning voice of a long absent
                        friend. Down to the pastures, where was more network and more dew, but when
                        one has nothing to speak of in the way of boots, the state of the ground is
                        of the less consequence.</p>
                    <p>The <persName ref="tailor">Tailor</persName> had been right; there was no
                        lack of mushrooms at this time of the morning. All over the pasture they
                        stood, of all sizes, some like buttons, some like tables; and in the
                        distance one or two ragged women, stooping over them with baskets, looked
                        like huge fungi also.</p>
                    <p><said who="tommy">" This is where the fairies feast,"</said> said <persName

                        downstairs.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile the poor <persName ref="tailor">Tailor</persName> came wearily
                        downstairs. Day after day, since his wife's death, he had come <pb n="78"
                            xml:id="VAB6984-082"/> down every morning to the same desolate sight -
                        yesterday's refuse and an empty hearth. This morning task of tidying was
                        always a sad and ungrateful one to the widowed father. His awkward struggles
                        with the housework in which she had been so notable, <ref rendition="#super"
                            target="#note_049">1</ref> chafed him. The dirty kitchen was dreary, the
                        labor lonely, and it was an hour's time lost to his trade. But life does not
                        stand still while one is wishing, and so the <persName ref="tailor"
                            >Tailor</persName> did that for which there was neither remedy nor
                        substitute; and came down this morning as other mornings to the pail and
                        broom. When he came in he looked round, and started, and rubbed his eyes;
                        looked round again, and rubbed them harder; then went up to the fire and
                        held out his hand (warm certainly) - then up to the table and smelt the
                        mush- rooms (esculent <ref rendition="#super" target="#note_050">2</ref> fungi
                        beyond a doubt)- handled the loaf, stared at the open door and window, the
                        swept floor, and the sunshine pouring in, and finally sat down in stunned
                        admiration. Then he jumped up and ran to the foot of the stairs, shouting,
                        -</p>
                    <p><said who="tailor">" Mother! Mother! Trouts' luck has come again. And yet, no

                    <p>And they went to sleep.</p>
                    <p>Day after day went by, and still the Brownies "stuck to it," and did their
                        work. It is no such very hard matter after all to get up early when one is
                        young and light-hearted, and sleeps upon heather in a loft without window
                        blinds, and with so many broken window panes that the air comes freely in.
                        In old times the boys used to play at tents among the heather, while the
                            <persName ref="tailor">Tailor</persName> did the housework; now they
                        came down and did it for him.</p>
                    <p>Size is not everything, even in this material existence. One has heard of
                        dwarfs who were quite as clever (not to say as powerful) as giants, and I do
                        not fancy that fairy godmothers are ever very large. It is wonderful what a
                        comfort Brownies may be in the house that is fortunate enough to hold them!
                        The <persName ref="tailor">Tailor</persName>'s Brownies were the joy of his
                        life; and day after day they seemed to grow more and more ingenious in
                        finding little things to do for his good.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays <persName ref="granny">Granny</persName> never picked a scrap for
                        herself. One day's shearings were all neatly arranged the next morning and
                        laid by her knitting-pins; and the <persName ref="tailor"
                        >Tailor</persName>'s tape and shears were no more absent without leave.</p>

                    <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB6984-085"/>

                    <p>One day a message came to him to offer him two or three days' tailoring in a
                        farmhouse some miles up the valley. This was pleasant and advantageous sort
                        of work: good food, sure pay, and a cheerful change; but he did not know how
                        he could leave his family, unless, indeed, the Brownie might be relied upon
                        to "keep the house together," as they say. The boys were sure that he would,
                        and they promised to set his water, and to give as little trouble as
                        possible; so, finally, the <persName ref="tailor">Tailor</persName> took up
                        his shears and went up the valley, where the green banks sloped up into
                        purple moor, or broke into sandy rocks, crowned with nodding oak fern. On to
                        the prosperous old farm, where he spent a very pleasant time, sitting level
                        with the window geraniums on a table set apart for him, stitching and
                        gossiping, gossiping and stitching, and feeling secure of honest payment
                        when his work was done. The mistress of the house was a kind, good creature,
                        and loved a chat; and though the <persName ref="tailor">Tailor</persName>
                        kept his own secret as to the Brownies, he felt rather curious to know if
                        the Good People had any hand in the comfort of this flourishing household,
                        and watched his opportunity to make a few careless inquiries on the
                        subject.</p>

                            Ay, Master, I have heard of them. When I was a girl, in service at the

                            of one they said had lived there in former times. He did housework as

                            the young ladies (that were then, they're all dead now) hid herself in a

                        and went home; down the valley, where the river, wandering between the green
                        banks and the sandy rocks, was caught by giant mosses, and bands of fairy
                        fern, and there choked and struggled, and at last barely escaped with an
                        existence, and ran away in a diminished stream; on up the purple hills to
                        the old ruined house. As he came in at the gate he was struck by some idea
                        of change, and looking again, he saw that the garden had been weeded, and
                        was comparatively tidy. The truth is, that <persName ref="tommy"

                        to their impatience, and to the difficulty of understanding the process of

                            behindhand with their sisters. Whether this altogether proceeds from
                            constitutional deficiency on these points in the masculine character, or
                            is one result among many of the code of by-laws which obtains in men's
                            moral education from the cradle, is a question on which everybody has
                            his own opinion. For the present the young gentlemen may appropriate
                            whichever theory they prefer, and we will go back to the story. The

                            Brownies become men, with all the cares of a prosperous farm on their
                            hands, and his girl-Brownie carry her fairy talents into another home.
                            For these Brownies - young ladies ! - are much desired as wives, whereas
                            a man might as well marry an old witch as a young
                        Boggartess."</said></p>
